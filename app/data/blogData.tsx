    <div>
      <p>
        Aaj ke time mein har Indian brand chahta hai ek fast, SEO-optimized aur custom branded website. WordPress aur Shopify jaise platforms popular hai,
        lekin unme kai limitations hain — jaise high monthly cost, slow speed, plugin dependency, aur limited design flexibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Custom websites using <strong>Next.js</strong> give full control, blazing-fast performance, Razorpay integration, and tailor-made UX. Yeh websites easily scale
        hoti hain, SEO-friendly hoti hain (thanks to SSR), aur ek baar banne ke baad recurring monthly cost nahi hoti – unlike Shopify or WordPress.
      </p>

      <p>
        Especially for Indian brands, hum local payment gateways, WhatsApp marketing, Hinglish content, aur mobile-first design easily integrate karte hain.
        Shopify pe aapko monthly ₹2–4k + app fees + cut dena padta hai. WordPress plugins update aur security ka jhanjhat laata hai.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Custom Next.js website</strong> is affordable (₹10k–25k setup), SEO smart, aur full branding control ke saath aata hai. Perfect for creators, DTC startups, 
        aur businesses jo India ke market ke hisaab se grow karna chahte hain.
